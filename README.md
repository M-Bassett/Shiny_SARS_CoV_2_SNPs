# Shiny_SARS_CoV_2_SNPs
Current working Repo for R scripts and corresponding files to interactively visualize mutations in SARS-CoV-2 from VCF files annotated with SNPeff
Hello!

This is currently under construction, but the scripts that are uploaded work with a subset of example data provided

Simply download the for_github folder and the R scripts
Set the working directory at the top of the before_shiny script to wherever you saved the github folder

Once you have run that script, then you can run the two R_shiny scripts (within the same RStudio session)

Have fun!
